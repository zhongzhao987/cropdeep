moment-datepicker
=================

The best bootstrap datepicker!

Original code from [Stefan Petre](http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-datepicker/). I also took things from [Andrew Rowls](https://github.com/eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker) and [Aymeric Kodono](https://github.com/Aymkdn/Datepicker-for-Bootstrap).

Moment Datepicker is ready to work with Knockout, TypeScript and NuGet. It uses Moment.js to parse dates and to localize the literals, and Twitter-Bootstrap (2 or 3) to ensure a nice appearance.

* [NuGet Package](https://nuget.org/packages/MomentDatepicker)
